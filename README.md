# Fake-SMS-Detection-using-NLP
This project focuses on using machine learning to identify fake SMS messages. SMS communication is widely used, but spam and fraudulent messages can be problematic. Our goal is to develop a system that can accurately distinguish real messages from fake ones using machine learning techniques. This will improve user experience and security in SMS communication. We'll cover steps like data preprocessing, feature creation, model training, and evaluation to create an effective solution. This work contributes to better communication quality and user safety.
